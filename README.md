4. SalariedProgrammer, HourlyProgrammer, CommissionProgrammer, BasePlusCommissionProgrammer.java:
   These files are subclass of Programmer.java.
   By using super() keyword, each of class gets basic info from Programmer.java.
   They also add their own features.

5. PaymeInterfaceTest.java:
   Entry point for testing each programmer class.
   It contains array to preset the programmer data.
   Used printf for clear view.
